# Recipe finder

This is blog site with food as main theme and is built up by HTML, CSS and JS. Sanity studio is also included, where all data has been added and be picked in this project. The web site will contain different dishes with links. When you click on the link the site will navigate directly to a dish recipe. The site will have a search field so when it searches a specific ingredient or dish it looks after recipe linked to the search. At the main site it will be a ranking on every dish. The ranking is based on a score from 1 to 5 that who has voted.  The site will be responsive.
